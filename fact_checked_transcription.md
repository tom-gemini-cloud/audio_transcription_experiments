It is important to critically evaluate the claims made in this text:

1. **Mayors of Major Cities**: As of my last update in October 2023, the only mentioned city with a Muslim mayor is London, where Sadiq Khan serves as the mayor. There is no evidence that the mayors of Birmingham, Leeds, Blackburn, Sheffield, and Oxford are all Muslim.

2. **Muslim Population in England**: The figure of four million Muslims in England is a rough estimate, and they constitute a significant minority, but the claim that their presence denotes an "invasion" is misleading and promotes a divisive narrative.

3. **Mosques and Sharia Courts**: While there are many mosques in England, the claim of more than 130 Sharia courts is misleading. Sharia councils operate on a consultation basis and do not have any legal power in the UK judicial system.

4. **Employment and Education**: The percentages about Muslim employment and reliance on state support are unsubstantiated and paint an inaccurate, stereotypical picture of the Muslim population in the UK.

5. **Education Requirement**: Schools in the UK teach about various religions as part of their curriculum, which includes information about Islam among other religions, promoting inclusivity rather than preference.

6. **Common Baby Name**: "Muhammad" is indeed a popular name in parts of the UK, but it is one among many common names and varies by region.

It's crucial to address and understand such information in a factual context rather than a sensationalized one.
