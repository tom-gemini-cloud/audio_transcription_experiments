Let's fact-check the statements one by one:

1. **Mayors in England**: 
   - The Mayor of London, as of October 2023, is Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim.
   - The Mayor of Birmingham is not necessarily Muslim; the position rotates annually among council members.
   - Leeds has a Lord Mayor who also changes annually and may not be Muslim.
   - Blackburn's mayoral position also rotates and may or may not be held by a Muslim individual at any given time.
   - Sheffield's Lord Mayor changes annually and isn't always a Muslim.
   - Oxford's Lord Mayor similarly rotates.

2. **Muslim Population in England**:
   - There are approximately 3 to 4 million Muslims in the UK, but this number includes all of the UK, not just England.

3. **Mosques in England**:
   - There are around 1,500 mosques across the UK.

4. **Sharia Courts and Councils**:
   - Estimates suggest there are around 30 Sharia councils operating informally within the UK; however, these are not official courts.

5. **Employment Statistics for Muslims**:
    - The claim that "78% of Muslim women do not work" lacks context and accuracy without specific data sources from reliable surveys or studies such as those conducted by ONS (Office for National Statistics). Employment rates can vary significantly based on numerous factors including age group, education level, etc., but blanket statements like this require careful consideration with up-to-date statistics.

6. **Muslim Families and State Support**:
    - Claims about family size and state support need specific statistical backing from credible sources like government reports or academic studies to verify accuracy.

7. **Education on Islam in Schools**:
    - Schools in the UK teach about various religions as part of religious education (RE), which includes Christianity, Islam, Judaism among others; it’s part of promoting understanding between different cultures rather than focusing solely on Islam.

8. **Most Common Baby Name**: 
    - Muhammad has been reported as one of the most popular baby names when considering its various spellings collectively across parts of England over recent years but isn't consistently ranked first nationwide every year due to variations depending on how data is compiled (e.g., combining different spellings).

9. **Comparison with Spain & Immigration Commentary**: 
    – This statement reflects personal opinion rather than factual analysis regarding immigration patterns or demographic predictions for Spain based on current trends without substantial evidence supporting such claims directly correlating population numbers with political outcomes similar to those described inaccurately above for English cities.

Overall many claims here mix some truths with exaggerations or inaccuracies requiring careful verification against reliable datasets before drawing conclusions about societal impacts related specifically towards religious demographics within broader contexts like employment rates or educational policies etcetera which involve multiple variables beyond singular religious identity alone impacting outcomes observed statistically across diverse populations living together today globally including both Europe & beyond alike!
